The objective of this project is to develop an effective system for detecting fake news
using machine learning algorithms. In a world where misinformation spreads rapidly, this system
aims to automatically classify news articles as either "fake" or "real" to combat the harmful
impact of false information. The project employs a range of machine learning algorithms,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, CART (Classification and
Regression Trees), Neural Networks, and Random Forest, to build a reliable model for fake news
detection. Key steps include data preprocessing (such as stopword removal, lemmatization, and
tokenization), transforming text into numerical features using TF-IDF, and training the models
on labeled datasets. The systemâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score, with the goal of optimizing accuracy while reducing errors.
Ultimately, this project aims to create a scalable and deployable solution that contributes to the
fight against misinformation and supports informed public discourse.
